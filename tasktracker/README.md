1. When new a task, the user can enter any id, but the system will report the
error when the id is Invalid or the user is not the manager of the given Id.
2. In the todo tasks page, user can choose to start/stop current task.
  - When he/she start, he/she can never change the start time
  - When he/she stop, he/she can restart, the task will change from completed
  -> not completed, the task start time will still be the origin start time.
3. The time-zone is Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
